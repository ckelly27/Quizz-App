# Quiz App
A quizlet-like program 
### Why?
This was a program that I have always wanted to create, but never got around to actually doing it. Obviously, that time did eventually come, and I have created it. 
The purpose of my creation of this program is twofold:

Firstly, to refamiliarize myself with Python, after having not used it for a few months.

Second, as previously stated, this is something that I've always wanted to program, having taken heavy inspriation from Quizlet. For me, Quizlet works perfectly fine in most cases.
However, I have noticed from time to time, when using its "test" feature, some of the multiple choice answers that it seems to pull from other terms of a set are obviously not a question's answer. As a result, I feel as though I am not learning the contents of a set as best as possible. This would be find, but as far as I can tell, there isn't really a way to input your own extraneous answers. Such a problem has led to the creation of this program.

### How?
I created this program using Python's Tkinter library to construct a GUI that allows users to interact with the tool. I find that the implementation of a GUI makes a program far more accessible and easier to use compared to one where its users can only interact with it via a terminal. I also used the CSV library to handle the creation and reading of CSV files, the file type in which the study sets are stored. Additionally, I used the OS to allow users to more easily browse through existing CSV files to be used for study, as the alternative would've been for them to paste a filepath. Having used these libraries, I have created what I find to be an intuitive interface for both the creation and study of custom question sets.

### Future
I do plan on updating this program further. I intend to add a feature where users can edit existing sets, and further improving the GUI's aesthetics
